This repository contains methods of Material Science Technology in Real life Examples with Insights and Founding the fundamental understanding of them and use it in many ways.

This day 3,
We got 2 types of material Prediction
1) forward (from "given selective molecular" input we can get possible "properties" of that given molecular formula as output.)
2) backward (from "given selective properties" input we can get possible "molecular formula" output.)
