# Material-Machine-Learning-Programming-in-python-
This repository contains methods of Material Science Technology in Real life Examples with Insights and Founding the fundamental understanding of them and use it in many ways.

Two way Different approaches,
We got 2 types of material Prediction
1) forward (from "given selective molecular" input we can get possible "properties" of that given molecular formula as output.)
2) backward (from "given selective properties" input we can get possible "molecular formula" output.)

# Solubility and Diffusion in Metals
After certain degree of solute got dissolved in solvent (supersaturation), the undissolved solutes are making their own self bonding each other and with solvent partially or fully.
so the question is, what is probability of degree of bonding or dispersion of the extra undissolved solutes in the fully saturated solvent?
(Is it correlated with the size of ion or neutral atoms difference, electronegativity, influence of environmental factors like Pressure, Temp, or by other atoms presents)
# Task [1] for week 1
Build a unsupervised learning model to get the overall look on correlation between various groups of internstic parameters of atoms in a alloys Material Databases or Datasets.
